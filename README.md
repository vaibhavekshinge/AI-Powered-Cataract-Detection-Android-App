# AI-Powered-Cataract-Detection-Android-App
Designed and developed an Android application in Java focused on cataract eye detection. The project involved creating a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a comprehensive dataset of eye images to accurately diagnose cataracts. Integrated the trained model into the app, enabling it to process input images captured by the device, perform real-time analysis, and determine the presence of cataracts. The app then provides users with immediate diagnostic results. The project demonstrates expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and Android app development, with a focus on healthcare technology.
